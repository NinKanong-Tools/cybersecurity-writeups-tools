# WHOIS Lookup


### What is WHOIS Lookup?
WHOIS lookup is a query process used to retrieve information about a registered domain name, IP address, or autonomous system from a WHOIS database. The WHOIS protocol (defined in RFC 3912) allows users to access public records maintained by domain registrars and regional internet registries (RIRs). These records contain details about the ownership, registration, and technical configuration of internet resources.

### A WHOIS lookup typically returns:

Domain Information:

Domain Name: The registered domain (e.g., example.com).
Registrant Details: Name, organization, and contact information of the domain owner (often redacted for privacy due to regulations like GDPR).
Registrar: The company or organization that registered the domain (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap).
Name Servers: The servers handling DNS queries for the domain.
Registration Dates: Creation, last update, and expiration dates.
Domain Status: Codes indicating restrictions (e.g., clientTransferProhibited).

IP Address Information:

Organization: The entity assigned the IP (e.g., Google LLC for 8.8.8.8).
Net Range/CIDR: The IP range or subnet the address belongs to.
Abuse Contact: Email or phone for reporting abuse.
Geolocation: Sometimes included, depending on the registry.
