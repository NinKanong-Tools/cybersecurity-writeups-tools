### 3. Searching for similar usernames
```
sherlock google.com{?}
```
<img width="729" height="369" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdb68553-141c-43a8-8a4a-9f39498f17f5" />

```
sherlock 8.8.8.8{?}
```
<img width="537" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/106a9b08-ae5c-4535-9033-d415eea66444" />

- Sometimes, a username can be slightly different to a person we are searching for. We can also search for similar usernames with this tool as shown below.
- {?} will be replaced with – or hyphen or period (.).


### 4. Searching for multiple usernames at once
```
sherlock google facebook apple --site Instagram
```
<img width="424" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5e53c59-8b68-4854-b868-c2e0e5ea4d18" />

You can even search for multiple usernames with this tool as shown below. For example, let’s search for “google”, “facebook” and "apple"  on Instagram.


### 5. Using a proxy while searching
```
sherlock hackercoolmagazine --proxy 192.168.40.1:10180
sherlock hackercoolmagazine --proxy 192.168.40.1:10180 --timeout 30
sherlock hackercoolmagazine --proxy 192.168.40.1:10180 --print-all
```
<img width="582" height="517" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/411943da-c69a-406d-b8f7-e71b814448fa" />

- --timeout 30 to set a max wait time per site.
- --print-all to see all sites being checked.
- limit to one fast site like GitHub.
You can even route your query through a proxy to remain anonymous.

```
sherlock google --tor --timeout 20 --site GitHub
```
<img width="870" height="114" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d10e078-f571-4128-9ab7-bf8a5ba653d8" />


### 6. Dump the entire HTTP response
```
sherlock google.com --dump-response
```
<img width="439" height="411" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63ae8e32-ce16-4569-a291-a889a12edc58" />

<img width="595" height="358" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/127c10e4-fc54-4e07-83c8-f9c97646ad8e" />

<img width="866" height="378" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35663469-d5c5-44f4-9f50-c6cd0b92cd8c" />

<img width="516" height="156" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa69aead-9396-4b63-a65c-99d2e3e83741" />

We can even see the HTTP response of the site while searching using this option.

```
sherlock google --site GitHub --dump-response --output github_response.txt
```
<img width="654" height="315" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/578286d3-0e96-4f61-a110-f2b9bb87d012" />

```
cat github_response.txt
```
<img width="808" height="456" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52aea473-0bd9-46a8-be03-5be3cd781cf2" />


Why Dumping Responses Is Useful ?

Sometimes, websites: 
   - Return a fake 200 status code even for non-existent users
   - Redirect to login or captcha pages
   - Block requests from tools like Sherlock (e.g., via Cloudflare or rate limiting)

By dumping the response, you can: 
   - Confirm if you're seeing a login page instead of a real profile
   - Detect if your IP or proxy is being blocked
   - Verify whether the page contains "User not found" messages
     
- -dump-response : save raw HTTP response.

```
sherlock facebook --site Instagram --dump-response --verbose --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 --output instagram_dump.html
```
<img width="895" height="305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6470418-d01a-4177-a856-7c6070a76dd7" />


### 7. Time to call
```
sherlock facebook.com --timeout 1
```
<img width="460" height="566" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/952e4be6-11da-4f56-838e-56c06fcbdc90" />

```
sherlock google --timeout 10
```
<img width="501" height="324" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f194c42a-59e2-4bfc-8b31-551f19001350" />

<img width="490" height="279" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d8f897-2cf0-4ab7-95ad-f78fd4331649" />

- --timeout 1
   Sets the maximum wait time per site request to 1 second.
    - If a site takes longer than 1 second to respond, Sherlock will skip it and move on.
    - This makes the search faster but might cause missed results if a site is slow.

By default, while querying for usernames, this tool waits for 60 seconds for response to the request it made. With this timeout option, this time can be changed as shown below. The value should be set in seconds.


### 8. Print all the output
```
sherlock facebook --print-all
```
<img width="519" height="298" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b02522e1-57ca-4169-a519-34c50e74b909" />

<img width="405" height="170" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74209323-6184-4488-a984-94d0274c5a64" />

<img width="420" height="164" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18f26026-3264-4b70-bc90-3c07ec2b04ba" />

- --print-all
Tells Sherlock to show results for every site, even if the username was not found.
- Without --print-all → Sherlock only prints sites where the username exists.
- With --print-all → You’ll see:
   - Found accounts
   - Not found / unavailable
   - Timed out / error responses

By default, Sherlock only prints out the social network where the username was found. Using the option, we can see all the social networks this tool queries for and also the reason why it was not found.



### 9. Print only positives found
```
sherlock facebook --print-found
```
<img width="516" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70efadd3-bf46-4a1a-9149-9f7080823ba8" />

This option prints out all the social networks on which the username is found.


### 10. Search NSFW sites too
```
sherlock facebook --nsfw
```
<img width="522" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c9b951f-de2d-44ff-a071-5366dc14518f" />

- By default, sherlock doesn’t query NSFW sites while searching for a username. When we set this option, it even queries NSFW sites for the particular username.
- --nsfw
 This tells Sherlock to include NSFW (Not Safe For Work) websites in the search.
     - By default, Sherlock skips adult content platforms.
     - Adding --nsfw allows Sherlock to search on adult, explicit, or 18+ sites where the username might exist.


### 11. Writing the output to a file
```
sherlock hackercoolmagazine -o sherlock.txt
```
<img width="557" height="303" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75a24aff-fba0-4331-aaac-8fe143b39e87" />

Like any other tool, we can use Sherlock too to save the output to a file of our choice using the “-o” option as shown below.
