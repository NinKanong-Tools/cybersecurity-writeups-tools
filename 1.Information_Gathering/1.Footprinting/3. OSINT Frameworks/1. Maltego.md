# Maltego

## What Is Maltego?
- Maltego is a tool that leverages open-source intelligence (OSINT) developed by
Paterva. Maltego comes in different versions, including a community edition that can
be used for free with some limitations, as well as commercial versions that offer more
features and capabilities.
- Maltego is a vital tool in the arsenal of a penetration tester. As a graphical link
analysis tool, it lets you visualize connections within complex data sets, displaying
interconnected links. By analyzing information from various sources such as public
websites, email addresses, social media, and cryptocurrency transactions, Maltego
aids in uncovering hidden relationships and patterns.
- This is particularly useful in penetration testing, where understanding the target's
digital footprint and connections can be crucial. Working up to 80% faster with
Maltego than traditional methods allows for efficient reconnaissance.


## Starting Up
We will now show you how to get Maltego up and running. For our demo moving
forward, we will be using Kali. Maltego can also be installed on Windows, macOS, and
other Linux distributions.
Before you can run Maltego, you need to run the installer, which can be found in the
Applications menu under “Information Gathering.”

You will be taken to a terminal window if you want to install Maltego. Select “Y” to
continue.

Now, you can start Maltego by entering maltego in the terminal or running it
from the application menu.
Once Maltego opens, you will be shown a window asking you to select a
product. We are using the “Maltego CE (Free)” version for our demo. Select “Run”
to continue.

Application Menu
In the Application menu, you'll find the application button. This grants access to the
following functions:
New Graph
Open Graph
Save
Save All
Save As
Maltego can open and save graphs using the .mtgl extension. While these are some
of the core features, there are also other advanced functions.
1.Start Page
The start page showcases the latest updates for products, Transform, and the
Transform Hub. Any alerts affecting Maltego's functionality and security can also be
found here.
1.Transform Hub
The Transform Hub catalogs all the Transforms offered by Maltego, third-party
providers, or available through an API/dataset. You can either purchase these items
or install them for free.

- Transforms in Maltego are specialized pieces of code that process
- information in a very particular way. They take an Entity (a defined piece
- of data like an email address, IP address, or name) as input and then
- search for related information, returning more Entities as output

Let's walk through installing Transforms in Maltego's Community Edition. First,
navigate to the Transform Hub within the software.

Since we're using the Community Edition, you'll want to filter the available
Transforms by selecting “Maltego Community” from the “Plans” menu. This will show
you only the Transforms compatible with our version, making choosing and installing
the ones you need easier.

You’ll also want to display Transforms that are “NOT INSTALLED.”

Now that we have the Transforms that will work for us let’s choose one to install. At
the time of writing, there are 50 Transforms available to you in the Community
Edition—everything from infrastructure and network information to searching social
media sites.
Let’s install the Censys Transform, designed to map IP addresses to the target
domain and vice versa, quickly identify server misconfigurations, and efficiently scan
attack surfaces for vulnerabilities

Choose "censys"


## Starting an Investigation
The easiest way to start a new investigation is by using Machines in Maltego. These
Machines are automated sequences of Transforms in Maltego that allow users to run
multiple queries or operations with a single click.

We will demonstrate how to use a Machine in Maltego, specifically focusing on the
“Company Stalker” Machine. This Machine aims to locate email addresses associated
with a domain, map these to corresponding social media profiles, and finally, attempt
to retrieve or analyze any related metadata.

To begin, click on the “Machines” tab at the top of the Maltego window.

For a more detailed investigation, you can also run one manually. If you want to start
a new project in Maltego, the first step is to select “New” in the Application menu. 

<img width="912" height="901" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f12c990-4b25-49b2-a598-32fd4061bc0b" />

You will then be presented with different screens, such as the “Entity Palette,”
“Graph,” “Output,” and “Run View.”

<img width="912" height="901" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dac34ef-35ff-4937-8fbc-3a1e95b8ab92" />

To begin your investigation, you will now want to add an “Entity” to the new graph.
The easiest way to do this is using the “Entity Pallete” on the main interface's left
side. You can either scroll through the list of entities or use the search function.

- In Maltego, an Entity represents a single piece of data you want to
- investigate or analyze. It can be something as simple as an email
- address, a phone number, a domain name, or an IP address.
