# Amass

## What is the purpose of Amass?
Amass is a proven, open source reconnaissance toolkit primarily used for network mapping and information gathering. It is widely used among security professionals and researchers to discover assets belonging to a target system and to map the external network space for preliminary analysis of the target system.

Here are the primary uses of Amass:

   - Subdomain Enumeration: Amass is used to find subdomains of a target domain, essential for preliminary reconnaissance of the target system in the process of penetration testing and security assessment.

   - DNS Enumeration: The Amass tool makes a DNS enumeration to help information security professionals collect data on DNS records for understanding the target's infrastructure. On the other hand, it provides very relevant information to security professionals or cybercriminals in mapping a domain's footprint and possible vulnerabilities, detailing hostnames, IP addresses, and DNS record types.

   - Asset Discovery: Amass helps in the identification of several assets associated with a domain, their IP addresses, and services that go with them, so the attack surface of a target is visible.

   - Data Correlation: Amass can collect, correlate and analyze intelligence data from various sources, such as passive and active reconnaissance, to provide a complete picture of a target. This makes it a more useful tool for security professionals or researchers.

   - Visualization: It offers visualization to help users understand the relationships between discovered assets, therefore making it even easier to identify potential attack vectors. As a user-friendly security tool, amass is very useful because of these capabilities.

## Usage of Amass

## 1. Help and Usage Information

```
amass -h
```

## 2. amass intel

```
amass intel -h
```

The ‘intel’ subcommand is used to discover targets to perform enumeration later. We can specify an IP address, IP address range, domain etc as targets to this command.

```
amass intel -whois -d google.com
```
