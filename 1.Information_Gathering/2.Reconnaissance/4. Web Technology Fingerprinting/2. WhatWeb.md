What is WhatWeb?
WhatWeb is an open-source tool designed to identify various technologies used by a website. By running WhatWeb against a target URL, it will enumerate and provide details about:
   - Web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS)
   - CMS (Content Management System) such as WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal
   - Programming languages in use (e.g., PHP, Ruby, Python)
   - Web frameworks (e.g., React, Django, Laravel)
   - Libraries and APIs (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Maps)
   - Security features (e.g., SSL/TLS, security headers)
   - Plugins and server-side components
