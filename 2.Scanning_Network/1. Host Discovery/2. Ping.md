# Ping


### What is Ping?
Ping is a network diagnostic tool used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network and measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer.

## Ping in Linux

### Usage:
  | short form  |       Description                                                       |
  |-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `-t:`       | Use this option to continuously send ping requests to the target system.|
  | `-a:`       | This option helps unveil the hostname of the target IP address.|
  | `-n:`       | This option sets the number of echo requests.|
  | `-l:`       | This ping parameter specifies the size of an echo request packet, typically in bytes.|
  | `-f:`       | This IPv4-centric option prevents echo request fragmentation by intermediary routers.|
  | `-i:`       | This ping option sets the life span or TTL value of a request packet. The maximum value is 255.|
  | `-v:`       | This option specifies the type of service (TOS) applicable for a particular echo request.|
  | `-r:`       | This IPv4-based option sets the number of hops between two communicating nodes.|
  | `-s:`       | This option displays the time in internet timestamp format for every ping request sent/received.|

### 1. Basic Ping
````
ping 192.168.127.129
ping google.com
````

- This command use to check if host or IP is alive.


### 2. specific use of the ping utility
````
ping -c 4 google.com
````
<img width="695" height="206" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b64b6cdc-a5dd-4b00-8c8b-d272a8b6fec3" />

- -c 4 : specifies the number of ICMP Echo Request packets to send.
- This command send 4 ping packets and stop


### 3. Verbose output
````
ping -v google.com
````
<img width="864" height="275" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f446e52e-38bf-4567-ada6-ea104818f55d" />

- This command use to show verbose output.

### 4. Set packet size in bytes
````
ping -s 128 google.com
````
<img width="745" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8c717ba-4e58-4311-a8d2-d7db99f8cb01" />

- This command uses the ping utility to test the reachability of the host google.com with a custom packet size.
- -s 128 : specifies the number of data bytes to send in each ICMP Echo Request packet.


### 5. Set interval between pings 
````
ping -i 2 google.com
````
<img width="698" height="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f805eab2-a4f9-4719-a99c-d3509a1b316c" />


### 6. Set timeout in seconds
````
ping -W 2 google.com
````
<img width="748" height="228" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88fba15e-ac13-4d2c-a2e1-7aed05880f42" />

- This command uses the ping utility to test the reachability of google.com with a specific timeout setting.
- -W2 : sets the timeout (wait time) for each ICMP Echo Reply to 2 seconds.


### 7. Use specific network interface
````
ping -I eth0 192.168.127.129
ping -I eth0 google.com
````
<img width="722" height="493" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bae53c6-fcb9-498f-a5f2-824cb2c64800" />

- This command uses the ping utility to test the reachability of google.com by sending ICMP Echo Request packets through a specific network interface.
- -I eth0 : specifies the network interface to use for sending ping packets. The -I flag stands for "interface," and eth0 is the name of the network interface.


### 8. Audible ping (beep)
````
ping -a google.com
````
<img width="745" height="192" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ecdb4fb-e44d-42bc-9b78-5508877a0c8e" />

- This command uses the ping utility to test the reachability of google.com, but the -a option is not universally supported across all ping implementations.
- -a : use to audible ping.


### 9. Quiet output (summary only)
````
ping -q -c 4 google.com
````
<img width="511" height="143" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12a66f9c-8999-4a1e-bdb3-3de8dbdba429" />

- This command uses the ping utility to test the reachability of google.com with specific options for quiet mode and a limited number of pings.
- -q : enables "quiet" mode.
- -c 4 : specifies the number of ICMP Echo Request packets to send.


### 10. Flood ping (fastest possible, root required)
````
ping -f 192.168.127.129
````
<img width="623" height="141" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8465273-9895-41ae-ad11-db46493e07ca" />

- This command uses the ping utility with superuser privileges to test the reachability of google.com in flood mode. If we don't use sudo it didn't work.
- -f : enables "flood" mode. In flood mode, ping sends ICMP Echo Request packets as fast as possible (limited by the system and network conditions) without waiting for replies, overwhelming the target with requests. It displays a dot (.) for each sent packet and an E for each error or lost packet.


### 11. Set TTL (time to live)
````
ping -t 64 google.com
````
<img width="712" height="188" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9d2357f-a957-4ed7-9d1d-33e2c1f9ff88" />

- This command uses the ping utility to test the reachability of google.com, but the behavior of the -t option depends on the operating system.
- -t 64 : equivalent for setting the Time to Live (TTL) is -t (lowercase)


### 12. Add timestamp to each ping
````
ping -D google.com
````
<img width="880" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd3b125b-be89-4b61-ba3e-8f138fbaf6fb" />

- uses the ping utility to test the reachability of google.com, but the -D option is not a standard flag in the GNU iputils version of ping, which is commonly used on Linux distributions.
- -D : use to add timestamp to each ping.


### 13. Ping multiple hosts
````
for ip in 192.168.127.{1..100}; do ping -c 1 $ip; done
````
<img width="622" height="543" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7a7db5-63a7-41a7-afff-3ad250760107" />

- Loop through IP range



## Ping in Windows

### 1. Check if host is alive
````
ping google.com
````
<img width="498" height="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4ca2501-a8c7-4218-be4a-7ac966f8eb7c" />




### 2. Send 4 packets and stop
````
ping -n 4 8.8.8.8
````
<img width="434" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c62197e6-f0eb-414d-ba66-3e79c4fba2cb" />

- -n 4 : specific to the Windows version of ping.



### 3. Set packet size in bytes
````
ping -l 128 google.com
````
<img width="488" height="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc0d76b5-61e3-485d-968a-749a6f0286c5" />

### 4. Force IPv4
````
ping -4 google.com
````
<img width="493" height="233" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/774219b0-8994-46e7-9edf-4cd7a2eccd42" />


### =============>>> End of Ping

### Why hacker use ping:
Hackers use ping for a variety of reasons, mostly in the reconnaissance and network mapping phase of an attack. Here’s a detailed breakdown:
- Host Discovery:
    - Identify which machines are alive on a network.
    - Ping sends ICMP echo requests; if the target responds, the hacker knows the host is online.
    - like: `ping -c 1 192.168.1.10` . Confirms the host exists before attempting further attacks.
 
- Network Mapping:
    -  Determine the structure of a network (subnet size, active hosts).
    -  Using ping sweeps across IP ranges.
    -  like: `for ip in 192.168.1.{1..254}; do ping -c 1 $ip; done` . Finds all live hosts in the subnet.
 
- Checking Firewall or ICMP Rules.
- Latency & Network Health Monitoring.
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) Testing
- Evading Detection
