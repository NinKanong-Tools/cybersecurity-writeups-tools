# netdiscover


### What is netdisocver?
Netdiscover is an open-source network reconnaissance tool used to identify live hosts on a network by sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests and sniffing for replies. Itâ€™s particularly useful for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals for tasks like network auditing, device inventory, and identifying unauthorized devices. It operates in both active and passive modes:
      - Active Mode: Sends ARP requests to a specified IP range or network interface to discover live hosts, their IP addresses, MAC addresses, and often the hardware vendor.
      - Passive Mode: Silently sniffs network traffic for ARP packets without sending any requests, making it stealthier but slower, as it relies on existing network activity.
