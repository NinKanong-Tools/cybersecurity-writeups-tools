This command used to perform a TCP SYN scan on a single target IP address.

```
nmap -sS 192.168.100.1/24
```

is a TCP SYN scan (also known as a stealth scan) used to identify open ports on the specified IP range.
1. -sS: This flag specifies the scan type, in this case, a TCP SYN scan (also called a "stealth scan").
2. 2. 192.168.100.1/24: This is the target specification, indicating the IP range to scan. The /24 denotes a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, meaning Nmap will scan all IP addresses from 192.168.100.0 to 192.168.100.255 (256 addresses total).

```
nmap -iR 3 -vv
```

This is an Nmap command that performs a scan on 3 randomly selected IPv4 addresses with increased verbosity for detailed output. Nmap is a powerful open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. Below is a step-by-step explanation.
1. -iR 3:
   -iR: stands for "input from random" â€“ it instructs Nmap to generate and scan random IP addresses.
    3: specifies the number of random targets (hosts) to select from the entire public IPv4 address space (approximately 4.3 billion possible addresses, excluding reserved ranges like private IPs unless configured otherwise).
Nmap avoids scanning private/reserved IPs by default to prevent accidental local network scans.
2. -vv: Double verbose mode. This increases the output detail level:
   - Shows real-time progress (e.g., packets sent/received, timing).
   - Displays more information about discoveries, such as host status, open ports, and debugging info.
   - Useful for troubleshooting or understanding the scan's inner workings. For even more detail, you could use -vvv.
